# Data Cleaning – Customer Complaint Intelligence System

## Overview
This document details the pre-SQL data cleaning performed in Excel to standardize text fields, correct spelling errors, and handle invalid dates. Cleaned datasets were then imported into SQL Server for modeling and analysis.

## 5. Notes

- Standardizing regions ensures accurate reporting and prevents fragmentation in dashboards.  
- Fixing spelling errors in complaints and resolutions enables reliable keyword-based sentiment scoring and urgency evaluation.  
- Invalid dates set to `NULL` allow correct time-based aggregations in SQL, such as risk scoring and complaint aging.  
- All cleaning steps were documented for traceability and reproducibility.
